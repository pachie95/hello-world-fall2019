            <h1>A Brief History</h1>

            <p>Hello, my name is Patrick Nedumackal but everyone calls me Pachie. I am 24 years old and I was born in Evanston, Illinois but moved to Glenview when I was very young.
                In my spare time I enjoy playing and watching sports. I play basketball competively and play football on occassion. I went to undergrad at the University of Illinois at Chicago and graduated in the Spring of 2018. 
                From there I worked at two different companies; the first being a logistics company which I hated and then the second at the utility company Nicor Gas.
                After working at Nicor Gas; it motivated to further my career and learn some new skills which is why I signed up for Coding Temple. 
            </p>
