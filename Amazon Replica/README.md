# Coding Temple Week 1 Code Review

### There are a few things that you will need to change regarding your Amazon replica project. I've outlined my suggested changes inside of your CSS file.

### Things to practice:
- Continue working on how things are placed on the page. Brushing up on how HTML elements can be positioned using absolute and relative positioning will help in future projects.

- Also, make sure to review the box-model, how it works and how things are calulated inside of it using the width,height,padding,border, and margin. Understanding this will allow you more flexibility in the way you can place things on your page(s).
